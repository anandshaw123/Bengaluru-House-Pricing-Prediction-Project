**How Our Project Works**














In this data science project walks through step by step process, how to build a **Real Estate Price** prediction WebSite.we will selecting **best model** using **GridSearchCv** and then i will build a model using Sklearn and **Linear Regression** using **Bengaluru_House_Prices** dataset from kaggle. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html,css and javascript file that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to **retrieve** the predicted price. During model building. i shall cover all data science concepts such as **data load** and **data cleaning**, **outlier detection** and **removal**, **feature engineering**, **dimensionality reduction**, **gridsearchcv** for **hyperparameter tunning**, **k fold cross validation** etc.




•**Python**

•**Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning**

•**Matplotlib for data visualization**

•**Sklearn for model building**

•**Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE**

•**Python flask for http server**
